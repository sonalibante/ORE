/*! The DiscountRatioModifiedCurve depends on three other yield curves. The dependency is via the discount factor.
    In particular, the discount factor \f$P(0, t)\f$ at time \f$t\f$ is given by:
    \f[
      P(0, t) = P_b(0, t) \frac{P_n(0, t)}{P_d(0, t)}
    \f]
    where \f$P_b(0, t)\f$ is the base curve discount factor, \f$P_n(0, t)\f$ is the numerator curve discount factor
    and \f$P_d(0, t)\f$ is the denominator curve discount factor.

    A use case for this type of discount curve is where we need to discount cashflows denominated in a currency, call
    it currency 1, and collateralised in a different currency, call it currency 2. Let \f$P_{1, 2}(0, t)\f$ denote the
    discount factor on this curve at time \f$t\f$. Assume that we have curves for discounting cashflows denominated in
    currency 1 and currency 2 and collaterised in a common reference currency. Let \f$P_{1, ref}(0, t)\f$ and
    \f$P_{2, ref}(0, t)\f$ denote the discount factors on these two curves respectively. Assume also that we have a
    curve for discounting cashflows denominated and collateralised in currency 2. Let \f$P_{2, 2}(0, t)\f$ denote the
    discount factor on this curve at time \f$t\f$. Then, by using DiscountRatioModifiedCurve we can set up the
    following relation:
    \f[
      P_{1, 2}(0, t) = P_{2, 2}(0, t) \frac{P_{1, ref}(0, t)}{P_{2, ref}(0, t)}
    \f]
    The assumption here is that forward FX rates remain the same if the FX forward's collateral currency is switched
    from the reference currency to currency 2.

    \warning One must be careful about mixing floating reference date and fixed reference date curves together as the
             underlying curves in this yield curve and then moving Settings::instance().evaluationDate(). This is
             alluded to in the corresponding unit tests. If the <code>moving_</code> member variable of TermStructure
             had an inspector method, then we could enforce that all underlying curves here are either floating or fixed
             reference date curves.
