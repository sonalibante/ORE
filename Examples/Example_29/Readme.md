# Example 29

## About
This example demonstrates using fixed vs. float cross currency swap helpers. In particular, it builds a TRY collateralised in USD discount curve using TRY annual fixed vs USD 3M Libor swap quotes.

The portfolio contains an at-market fixed vs. float cross currency swap that is included in the curve building. The NPV of this swap should be zero when the example is run.
